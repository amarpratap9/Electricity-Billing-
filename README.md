The application provides a user-friendly interface for entering customer details, recording monthly consumption readings and generating bills based on predefined units prices. It automates the billing process and simplifies the management of customer accounts, reducing manual errors and improving efficiency.

The application utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface with various input fields and buttons. The customer details, including name, phone number and consumer number are recorded using entry widgets. The  application also allows entering the last month’s reading and current month’s reading to calculate the consumed units.

The total units consumed are calculated by subtracting the last month’s reading from the current month’s reading. The unit price is multiplied by the consumed units to calculate the total bill amount. Additional charges such as sub charge and discounts, are also calculated based on the unit price. The application displays the bill information in a  text area, including the customer details, consumed units  and the total  bill  amount.

The  application provides functionality  for  clearing the  bill area  and generating a new bill for each customer. It also includes an exit option to close the application.

Overall the electricity billing application simplifies  the billing process  for electricity companies and improves customer management . It demonstrates the use of Python programming and tikinter library for developing GUI-based application with data input, calculation  and text area display functionalities.
